# Machine Learning Pipelines in PySpark MLlib

We will create a Random Forest pipeline and use it to predict car prices in PySpark. 

We will accomplish it by completing each task in the project:

- Task 1 - Install Spark on Google Colab and load a dataset in PySpark
- Task 2 - Describe and clean your dataset   
- Task 3 - Create a Random Forest pipeline to predict car prices
- Task 4 - Create a cross validator for hyperparameter tuning
- Task 5 - Train your model and predict test set car prices
- Task 6 - Evaluate your modelâ€™s performance via several metrics
